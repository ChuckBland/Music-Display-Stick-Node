# Music-Display-Stick-Node
Sample WiFi Display System for Straight Line of Lights

This is the code code for my WiFi Music Visualizer System. It is being supplied as a sample from which others can create their own display nodes.

It is ESP32 based and uses the [ESP-NOW Protocol](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-now/overview) and [FastLED LED Library](https://www.fastled.io). The function of this node is to receive ESP-NOW WiFi packets and display the music information it contains.

# Requirements
1. Anything goes with light and size
2. NO ADDED SOUND
3. Provide your own DC power source
4. You will need to provide the MAC address of your node. The sample software reports this to the Serial Monitor at 115,200 bps.
